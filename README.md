An app to facilitate the creation and participation in decentralized ballots.

Electora is a trust minimized, privacy maximised voting protocol that uses the latest in a variety of Web3 technologies.

We are creating a voting system where

* All votes are secret until the ballot closes, and, 
* Voter identity is always secret, but,
* Anyone can verify the eligibility of a vote, and,
* Anyone can verify the counting of votes and eventual result

## What We Need

* User Experience (UX) expertise - Somebody who can help us design the UX for both ballot organisers and voters
* User Interface (UI) expertise - Somebody who can take the UX and design how a suitable interface should look
* Typescript/Javascript/WASM/Rust building/bundling expertise - We need [nucypher-ts](https://github.com/nucypher/nucypher-ts) bundled for and available in the browser and we've thus far failed in our attempts to make that happen
