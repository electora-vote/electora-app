Electora is a trust minimized, privacy maximised voting protocol that uses the latest in a variety of Web3 technologies.

## What We Are Building

We are creating a voting system where:

* All votes are secret until the ballot closes, and, 
* Voter identity is always secret, but,
* Anyone can verify the eligibility of a vote, and,
* Anyone can verify the counting of votes and eventual result

We do this using a combination of [Sismo Zero Knowledge Proofs](https://sismo.io) and [Threshold Condition Based Decryption](https://docs.threshold.network/applications/threshold-access-control/conditions-based-decryption-cbd).

## What We Need

### Users

We are looking for end user organisations:

* Who have a need to conduct elections and ballots and are dissatisfied with the current state of the art
* Who use a relatively simple voting mechanism (i.e. no vote delegation or proxy voting)
* Whose team are sufficiently familiar with Web3 tech to carry out some tasks manually (e.g. create a Sismo Group)
* Who have the resource and capacity to provide basic support to their constituent voters
* Whose constituents can reasonably be expected to be familiar with using an ethereum wallet within their browser
* Who are enthusiastic about the prospect of helping to build a new way to conduct elections!


### Contributors
* User Experience (UX) expertise - Somebody who can help us design the UX for both ballot organisers and voters
* User Interface (UI) expertise - Somebody who can take the UX and design how a suitable interface should look
* Typescript/Javascript/WASM/Rust building/bundling expertise - We need [nucypher-ts](https://github.com/nucypher/nucypher-ts) bundled for and available in the browser and we've thus far failed in our attempts to make that happen
